      Blackjack is a card game where the player (you) and the dealer bet to see who can get closes to 21 without going over. At the start of the game the player and the dealer is given two random cards from the deck. If anyone gets 21 they automatically win. If not, then the player is given the option to Hit or Stay. If they player Hits, another card is given to them and their hand is reevaluated. If they get 21 they win but if they go over 21 they bust, which means they lose. If they Stay, both the players and dealers cards are reevaluated and whoever is closest to 21 wins. Every game the player is given the option to lower or raise their bet. If they win they get earn what they betted, if they lose they lose what they betted, if there is a tie nothing happens!
